ServerState
    - maintains the current state of the server (role, log etc.)
    - also handles passed packets from the `UDPServer`. Valid ones are RequestVoteMessage and AppendEntriesMessage

UDPServer
    - handles incoming packets by parsing them and creating proper corresponding message struct.
      forwards the message struct to the `ServerState` who than handles the message.

EventTimer (by now prefer the serverState to handle this)
    - triggers after election timeout the corresponding procedure (change to candidate role and start a new election)
